# Dnscache PIC Module

Reads the dns cache of the system like `ipconfig /displaydns` would. No network calls are made since the [DnsQuery_W](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsquery_w) are executed with the query option [DNS_QUERY_NO_WIRE_QUERY](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dns/dns-constants). Resolves DNS-Record to IP address if the entry exists.
